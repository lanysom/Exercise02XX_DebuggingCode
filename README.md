# Exercise02XX Debugging Code

The windchill factor is the temperature that a person feels because of the wind. For example, if a thermometer reads 35 degrees Fahrenheit outside and the wind is blowing at 25 miles per hour (mph), the windchill factor causes it to feel like it is 8 degrees F. In other words, your 98-degree body loses heat as though it is 8 degrees outside.

You can calculate the wind chill factor using this online resource: https://www.weather.gov/epz/wxcalc_windchill.

The formula is complicated and you don't really need it for this exercise. Regarding the online tool the calculation is only valid for certain temperatures and wind speeds! Try to use the online calculation.

## Dealing with Errors

In this exercise you will debug code and deal with the errors that you find. 

### Getting started

Clone or download the code from this repository

## Code and Debug


## Code and Unit Test

Add a test project to your solution and test the following methods from the WindChillFactor class:
* ConvertCelsiusToFahrenheit
* ConvertFahrenheitToCelsius
* ConverMilesPerHourToMeterPerSecond
* ConverMeterPerSecondToMilesPerHour
* CalulateChillFactorTemperatue

## Handle Invalid Errors

Enhance the Meteorology project to handle values outside the boundaries incl. return appropriate values to clients of the code.   

Create test methods to verify correctness.
